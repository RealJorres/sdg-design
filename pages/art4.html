                <p><b><i>April, 2021</i></b> - Barangay officials are the frontline providers of government services in the Philippines, connecting citizens with essential programs and projects at the grassroots level. In Santa Cruz, Marinduque—a municipality with 55 barangays—officials often face challenges that impact the efficiency and effectiveness of governance. A recent program developed to address these needs is providing critical training and skill-building opportunities for these public servants, with the goal of improving local governance and supporting community development.</p>
                <p>Santa Cruz’s barangay officials encounter a range of issues that affect their ability to fulfill their roles. According to a recent survey, many Punong Barangays have limited formal education (with 46.1% being high school graduates) and minimal access to advanced training, with only 15.4% able to attend national-level seminars. As a result, a significant portion of barangay officials (79.49%) reported challenges in barangay management, while 89.7% expressed a desire for further professional development to benefit their communities. This need for skill enhancement is especially critical in areas like policy implementation, ordinance writing, financial management, and other core governance responsibilities.</p>
                <p>This program was launched to close the skills gap among the elected and appointed barangay officials in Santa Cruz, equipping them to deliver more effective governance. The program's objectives include:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Mitigating Gaps in Governance Skills</b>: Strengthening the knowledge and competencies of barangay officials in administrative and governance tasks to ensure effective local governance.</li>
                    <li><b>Promoting High Performance</b>: Enhancing specific job-related skills for barangay leaders to improve service delivery and policy-making.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The training program is structured into three key phases, each targeting specific roles and skill sets needed by the officials:</p>
                <p><b>Phase 1: Mandatory Training for Punong Barangays</b>: Focused on essential governance skills, this phase consisted of sessions on records management, ordinance writing, project proposal creation, financial management, and parliamentary practices. The goal was to develop foundational skills necessary for barangay leaders to manage local administrative tasks efficiently.</p>
                <p><b>Phase 2: Core Skills for Secretaries and Treasurers</b>: This phase provided job-essential training for barangay secretaries and treasurers, focusing on records management, financial administration, and compliance with government protocols, including data privacy and public safety. This training was designed to ensure that officials could support effective governance at the barangay level.</p>
                <p><b>Phase 3: Management Training for Barangay Kagawad</b>: The third phase targeted Barangay Kagawad, focusing on leadership development and creating Barangay Development Plans. Conducted across nine districts in two groups, this phase included sessions on strategic planning and parliamentary procedures, equipping Kagawads with the skills needed for policy-making and community development initiatives.</p>
                <p>The training program demonstrated impressive results in skill improvement among barangay officials:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Barangay Secretaries</b>: 98% improved skills in writing minutes, project proposals, and barangay resolutions, enhancing administrative accuracy and effectiveness.</li>
                    <li><b>Barangay Kagawad</b>: 90% improved their parliamentary protocol skills and acquired proficiency in developing Barangay Development Plans, contributing to more effective governance.</li>
                    <li><b>Punong Barangays</b>: 93% gained essential knowledge in government policy, data privacy, and public safety, along with a deeper understanding of barangay laws and orders.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The program’s P600,000 budget was fully funded by the Liga ng mga Barangay, with support from local institutions including Marinduque State University (MarSU), which provided resource speakers and digital modules. Multimedia equipment from MarSU and sound systems from the Liga ng mga Barangay further supported the training.</p>
                <p>Unlike traditional training programs that rely on limited and often infrequent national seminars, this project uses a Training Needs Assessment (TNA) tool to identify and prioritize skill gaps, followed by targeted, in-depth local training sessions. This approach ensures all barangay officials in Santa Cruz have equitable access to capacity-building opportunities, regardless of funding limitations or location constraints.</p>
                <p>By equipping barangay officials with critical governance skills, this program is enhancing the efficiency, effectiveness, and overall competency of local governance in Santa Cruz. Through a structured, needs-based training model, barangay officials are now better prepared to manage their communities, deliver essential services, and foster sustainable development, ensuring that even the most remote communities receive the support they need for growth and resilience.</p>
