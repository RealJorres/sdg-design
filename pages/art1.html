                <p><b><i>January, 2021</i></b> - The Marinduque State University (MarSU) Free-Range Chicken Multiplier Breeder Farm Project was established in response to the Philippine government's call to aid economic recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic. This extension project supports people empowerment and community development by providing local farmers with sustainable poultry-raising options. Through this initiative, MarSU has introduced a free-range chicken production system that not only offers a cost-effective, viable source of income but also promotes environmentally friendly farming practices.</p>
                <p>Poultry production, particularly free-range chicken farming, is a practical enterprise for small-scale farmers due to its low capital requirements, high market demand, and relatively short production cycle. Compared to traditional, intensive caged systems, free-range farming creates a more humane and natural environment for poultry, allowing chickens to utilize farm resources, such as crop residues, as feed. This setup reduces waste and mitigates environmental issues, making it a sustainable and profitable option for farmers in Marinduque.</p>
                <p>The project aims to establish a sustainable breeder farm that produces high-quality poultry stocks for local farmers, supporting livelihoods and improving income levels. With funding from the Department of Agriculture's National Livestock Program, the project enhances food security, and strengthens the local economy.</p>
                <p>The project was structured around multiple key components, from establishing infrastructure to training beneficiaries:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Construction of Poultry Houses and Infrastructure</b>: The farm facilities, including poultry houses, were built to accommodate breeding, feeding, and incubation, ensuring healthy and efficient production cycles.</li>
                    <li><b>Procurement of Resources</b>: Essential inputs, such as parent stocks, feeds, biologics, and equipment, were sourced to support the operational needs of the breeder farm.</li>
                    <li><b>Training Programs</b>: Over three years, the project trained 166 farmers and 146 students in free-range chicken production. The training focused on raising and managing poultry for egg and meat production, including hands-on skills in chicken dressing for students.</li>
                    <li><b>Stock Dispersal Program</b>: A total of 3,373 free-range chicken stocks were dispersed, amounting to Php 629,385.62. Participating farmers could raise free-range chickens in farm and community settings, contributing to a local production of 561,730 eggs and 1,284.5 kg of chicken meat.</li>
                    <li><b>Community Engagement and Monitoring</b>: The project team engaged with local government units, People’s Organizations, and NGOs to enhance outreach and continuously monitor the program's impact on beneficiaries.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The project has provided measurable economic and social benefits for the Marinduque community:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Increased Livelihood Opportunities: Farmers involved in the program gained an additional source of income, allowing them to diversify their revenue streams and achieve a more stable financial outlook.</li>
                    <li>Sustainable Food Production: By producing free-range eggs and meat locally, the project contributed to meeting provincial food demands, addressing 2.35% of egg demand and 0.035% of chicken meat demand.</li>
                    <li>Environmental Sustainability: The use of farm waste as feedstuff reduced reliance on commercial feeds, lowered production costs, and improved farm waste management practices.</li>
                    <li>Enhanced Community Knowledge: Through hands-on training, farmers and students acquired valuable skills in poultry farming, empowering them to continue sustainable farming practices beyond the program.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Unlike conventional poultry farming, which relies heavily on commercial feed and intensive housing systems, the MarSU free-range production model supports:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduced Dependence on Commercial Feeds: Using crop residues and other farm resources as feedstuff reduces costs and promotes a circular economy within the farm ecosystem.</li>
                    <li>Healthier and Safer Food Choices: Free-range poultry are less susceptible to disease, and their eggs and meat offer a healthier alternative to conventional poultry products.</li>
                    <li>Lower Environmental Impact: Free-range systems are less resource-intensive and offer improved waste management, making them a sustainable choice for small-island farming communities.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The MarSU Free-Range Chicken Multiplier Breeder Farm Project exemplifies an innovative, community-centered approach to rural development in Marinduque. By providing sustainable livelihood opportunities, supporting local food production, and promoting environmental stewardship, this project has fostered resilience and self-reliance among small-scale farmers, ensuring a stable and sustainable future for Marinduque’s agricultural sector.</p>
